                        <div class="col-md-10"><p><strong>In 2010, Laurent Ribardière (CEO of 4D, the company he founded in
                            1984) had an intuition:</strong><br/><br/>Very quickly, companies must simplify and rationalize
                            their development process for cross-channel applications if they want to consolidate their
                            strategy
                            for deploying professional business applications.<br/><br/>He understood very soon the potential
                            of
                            JavaScript as a standard language for creating digital projects. He thus had the personal
                            conviction
                            of unifying front-end and back-end technologies around JavaScript to offer developers the means
                            to
                            rapidly conceive, produce and deploy high-performance applications.<br/><br/>Such a platform,
                            agnostic in terms of technology, able to integrate any framework, and to integrate into existing
                            enterprise environments would represent considerable benefits for enterprises in terms of
                            productivity and the rationalization of investments.</p></div>

                    <p>Laurent is an IT and software industry icon. Alongside Asmae Benkirane, they&rsquo;ve launched the
                        Wakanda project with the ambition of revolutionizing the development, deployment and maintenance of
                        mobile and desktop applications. Together, they have imagined and created the first unified development
                        environment, bringing together client-side Web standards (HTML &amp; CSS) and their object manipulation
                        on the server side, with a basis in JavaScript. This is the first end-to-end JavaScript platform on the
                        market.<br/><br/>Laurent has audaciously made his mark on IT history for thirty years with his software
                        innovations. In 1984, when Apple launched the first Macintosh, he wrote ABC Base, the first graphical
                        relational database management system, which became 4D. A developer at heart, he hasn&rsquo;t stopped
                        innovating, offering the first graphical RDBMS with integrated client-server running in 32-bit, and then
                        the first database with an integrated Web server, as well as the first integrated system for dynamic
                        application sharing.<br/><br/>Laurent&rsquo;s DNA is made of a subtle mix of innovation and creativity,
                        focused on one goal: To simplify the life of developers and make their work more enjoyable.<br/><br/>As
                        founder of the 4D group, over which he presides, Laurent is a self-made man. As CTO, he oversees the
                        development of Wakanda in order to offer users the best Web and mobile development experience and to
                        meet the present and future needs of enterprise.</p>
                    <blockquote>Wakanda is imbued with the same philosophy as 4D, offering an innovative open source solution
                        that simplifies and accelerates the development of mobile and desktop business applications. In a single
                        click, the development platform can be installed and allow development teams to quickly work together
                        and focus on the business needs of the project. I want to simplify developers&rsquo; lives the same way
                        I&rsquo;ve simplified my own.

                    <blockquote>I was won over by Wakanda right from the start &ndash; I felt that the company had a high level
                        of technical expertise and the desire to create an innovative environment that would set it apart from
                        its competitors. They already understood a great deal about developers&#39; needs and had a clear vision
                        of the stakes involved for companies. It was a fantastic opportunity for me &ndash; I could bring my
                        international experience to a company that was already highly internationalized, and make use of my dual
                        background in software engineering and marketing. We made a number of development choices and now the
                        market has proven that the choices we made were the right ones.&quot;</blockquote><!-- ppl --></div>
