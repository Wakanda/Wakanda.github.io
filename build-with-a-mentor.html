            As you may know, today’s web and mobile environment is increasingly becoming more <br/>
            complex. To get things done, you have to use different technologies, frameworks and <br/>
            concepts such NodeJS, Angular, Ionic, emulators, design patterns, offline modes, <br/>
            automated testing etc. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is to assist you during the development of your project,  and to make sure you are <br/>
            aware of the best practices of the market.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Here is how it works:</strong></p>

            <div class="caption">Step 1</div>
            <p>
              Book a video conference with one of our developers to discuss your project. In the <br/>
              one-on-one time, our developer will also define <strong>the areas where you need help.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              ased on your project, we will assign a <strong>specific developer to your needs</strong> (that is <br/>
              important because you want to be working with a developer that knows your <br/>
              project).
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div class="boxed">
            <div class="caption">Step 2</div>
            <strong>
              At your own pace, contact your assigned developer to: 
            </strong>
            <ul>
              <li>solve bugs</li>
              <li>send code examples</li>
              <li>discuss concepts and frameworks</li>
              <li>or whatever you may need to move ahead with your project.</li>

        <h2>How much time do I need?</h2>
        <p>From our experience, developers will use <strong>1 to 2 hours per week</strong> to solve their issues
        and move ahead with their projects. It is important to keep in mind that Wakanda will 
        help you a great length but,  you are still the owner of your own progress.</p>
        <p>As an example, If you plan to deliver your app in the next 2 months, you will probably 
          need our 10h package to support your effort.
