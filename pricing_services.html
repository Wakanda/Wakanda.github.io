        <p><b>There is no magic bullet for App development. </b>
        <br><br>We need to schedule <b>a chat</b> 
        to develop your App wireframing, 
        <br>how many screens you need, 
        what is the flow of your App,
        <br>how scalable and secure your data needs to be,  
        <br>what is the best business model for your App.
        <br>
        <br> We are confident that, from our first questions, you will see that 
        <br>we are the best partners for your project.</p>
